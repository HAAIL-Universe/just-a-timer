MANIFESTO: Just a Timer

1. Personality Over Precision
   • Animated face that shifts emotional state (calm → anxious → celebratory) as time passes.
   • Non-clinical, charming UI that makes timing feel delightful rather than mechanical.
   • Face reactions are the primary feedback mechanism, not just a visual accent.

2. Minimal Friction, Maximum Speed
   • One-tap quick presets (5min, 15min, 1hr) for instant timer starts without input.
   • Every interaction should feel effortless and require minimal cognitive load.
   • Custom duration entry only when presets don't fit the moment.

3. Satisfying Completion Experience
   • Sound and haptic feedback at timer end create tangible, rewarding moments.
   • Celebratory face state celebrates the user's accomplishment.
   • Completion triggers joy, not just notification dismissal.

4. Everyday Companion
   • Designed for real-world use: cooking, workouts, studying, focus sessions.
   • Simplicity that works across all contexts without feature bloat.
   • Personality-driven design makes returning to the app feel habitual, not obligatory.
